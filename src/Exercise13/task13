Create a text file named Duke.txt. The following text should be included in the text file.

Duke had an amazing day out. He bought an amazing pair of goggles.
What he found most amazing was the price tag. €10! What an Amazing experience!

Create a Java program, which determines the number of occurrences of the word  ‘amazing’ (case insensitive) in the text file.
A Scanner object should be used to read the contents of the text file to the program.
Any exceptions that may occur should be gracefully handled by the program.
