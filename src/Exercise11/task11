You have recently started a new role as a Junior Software Developer.
A senior member of the Software Development team has asked you to perform the following task, and has given you some suggestions.
You have been asked to write a Java program that reads in the number of units sold of a product (in the last 12 months)
from a text file named, ‘Sales.txt’. You will need to create the text file.
The contents of the file to read in: Sales.txt
10 20 35 56
24 12 45 1
80 43 23 45
The Java program should calculate (i) the total number of units sold of the product and (ii) the average number sold per month.
This information needs to be subsequently written to a text file named, ‘Sales Summary.txt’.
It should also be displayed in the console as shown below.
