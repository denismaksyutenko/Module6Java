Exercise 8
Create a class and include the main method.
In the main method, create an array of strings to store the names of popular holiday destinations in Ireland.
The length (size) of the array should be 5.
Initialise the array with the following values.
•	Cork
•	Athlone
•	Limerick
•	Sligo
•	Dublin
Output the contents of the array to the console using a standard for loop.
A Scannner object should be used to allow the user to enter a number.

The program should now use a separate loop for processing user input.
On validation of a correct entry, the program will display an appropriate message (a holiday destination) to the user and close.
However, if the user enters text instead of a number or enters a number outside the range of 1-5,
the program should gracefully be able to handle the exception generated.
The user should be allowed to keep re-entering a value until it has been successfully validated by the program.

Exercise 12

You have been asked to design a new computer game, which will run in the command prompt (MS-DOS).
The game is called ‘Lucky Number!’ The program should generate a random / lucky number, between 0-10 (inclusive).
The player should then be asked to guess the lucky number. They will be given three guesses.

The player is deemed to have lost the game, if they cannot guess the lucky number.
The player is deemed to have won the game, if they guess the random number generated by the program.

The player should not be penalized (lose a guess), if they enter invalid data,
for example, entering text for the number, or entering a number outside the game bounds (<0 and >10).
The player will only lose a guess, if they cannot guess the lucky number in the game bounds (0 to 10 inclusive).

Any exceptions that may occur should be gracefully handled by the program.
