Overview:

This is a complex exercise, and you may need to do some additional external research to complete it.

Duke’s 2000 Calorie Daily Diet, packs in as much good nutrition as possible, while trying to keep it simple, tasty and fun.
The user can select as many meals as they wish, but cannot exceed 2000 calories in total.

The Application:
•	The user should be presented with the following menu.

 Program Logic:
•	The user can select as many meals as they wish (one at a time),
    but they cannot exceed the daily total of 2000 calories (the program must prevent this).
•	The user can select the same meal many times, if they so wish.
•	If no meals have been selected, the program should simply display the message, “Goodbye”.
